1) Know your overall goal
- what are trying to do

2) Identify levers you can pull

3) Test a control vs variations
- have one CTA

4) Look at combined impact

5) Document learning

Deadly sins of landing pages - ideas for experimentation
1) Unclear call to action
2) Too many choices - visual shortcuts
3) Visual distractions
4) Not keeping promises
5) Too much text
6) Asking for too much information
7) Lack of trust & credibility
8) Features over benefits - personal choice

Higher CTA the better, more click rate
- you can test the campaign using Mailchimp
-> focus on small group, then change before sending to rest of mailing list
-> where's most important?
